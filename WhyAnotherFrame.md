# Introduction #

Jquery mobile is really nice, but it can't deal with fixed footer bar.

ajax page loading is cool , but old device run too slowly.

LazyMobile frame based on iScroll , so it has the fixed header and footer.

LazyMobile render a big page with div , every time show one div , there is no magic translation effect but only damn fast page switch .


LazyMobile also provide a data connector , which connect to website when network available ï¼Œ connect to local storage when network ungeiliable .
